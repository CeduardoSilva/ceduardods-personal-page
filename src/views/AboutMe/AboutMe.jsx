                I've been interested in technologies since childhood and my dream
                was to be able to create cool things using technology. Growing up,
                this dream evolved to be able to better the lives of people and
                try to effect social change using technology.
                <br /><br />
                And so I've studied Science and Technology at Universidade Federal do ABC
                one of the most innovative and scientificaly active Federal Universities in
                Brazil.
                <br /><br />
                This allowed me to work at IBM Brazil's Innovation Lab where I had
                contact with all kinds of technologies and exciting projects with
                an amazing team. We even managed to create a patent for Virtual Assistant's caching.
                <br /><br />
                I also had the privile of working with educational start-ups where I
                learned a lot about front-end development.
                <br /><br />
                My focus today is to share a lot more of what I do with the world
                by working on this site and blog and continue to grow my knowledge while
                working with people and companies to create amazing products and projects.
